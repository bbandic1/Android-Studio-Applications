# Android Studio Applications

This repository contains two mobile apps developed as part of the **Mobile App Development** course at my faculty. The apps were built using **Android Studio** and focus on different themes: one on **plants** and the other on **movies**. Both apps implement the required functionalities for their specific purposes.

## Apps Overview

### 1. Plant App
The Plant App provides comprehensive information on various plants, focusing on three key aspects:

- **Cooking Information**: Explore how the plant can be used in cooking, including recipes or culinary uses.
- **Medical Information**: Discover medicinal uses, health benefits, and any relevant precautions.

Additionally, users can:
- Add their own plants, including custom details and a photo.
- Search and browse plants based on their properties.

### 2. Movie App
The Movie App is designed to help users stay updated with upcoming movies and manage their favorite films. The app includes:
- **Search Functionality**: Look up movies by title or keyword.
- **Movie Details**: View information like plot summary, cast, release date, etc.
- **Upcoming Movies**: A dedicated section for checking out what's new and upcoming in theaters.
- **Favorites**: Save your favorite movies to easily find them later.

## Technologies Used
Both apps were developed in **Android Studio**, making use of:
- **Java/Kotlin** for app logic and functionality.
- **XML** for designing the user interface.

## How to Run
To run either app:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project folder in **Android Studio**.
3. Build the project and run it on an Android emulator or a physical Android device.
